# WhatsApp Sticker Pack Server (WASPS)

Backend for the [WASPC](https://github.com/Milanesa-chan/WhatsApp-Sticker-Pack-Creator "WASPC Repository") Web application. This project has been archived as development practices were inconvenient from the ground up and it's not a prority for the developer to fix it. Hope I have the time and knowledge to do it some day. Feel free to fork it and do what you want with this.

# How it Works

Here's a little diagram to try to explain the role of this application in the whole Web app. Everything inside the "WASPS" box is what can be found in this repository. As a detail the "WASPS Workers" have a copy of "WASPC" inside each of them and that is how they create stickerpacks independently.
