# WhatsApp Sticker Pack Server (WASPS)

Backend for the [WASPC](https://github.com/Milanesa-chan/WhatsApp-Sticker-Pack-Creator "WASPC Repository") Web application.

# How it Works

Here's a little diagram to try to explain the role of this application in the whole Web app. Everything inside the "WASPS" box is what can be found in this repository. As a detail the "WASPS Workers" have a copy of "WASPC" inside each of them and that is how they create stickerpacks independently.
